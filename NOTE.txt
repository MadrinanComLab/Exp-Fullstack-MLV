IN EARLIER PHASE, RUNNING OF LARAVEL AND VUE HAS DIFFERENT COMMAND:
LARAVEL: php artisan serve
VUE JS: npm run dev

TO CREATE THIS LARAVEL PROJECT, WE RUN:
composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-vue-survey

THEN WE CREATE DATABASE: laravel_survey

AFTER CREATING DATABASE, WE MODIFY .env AND CHANGES THIS:
DB_DATABASE=laravel_survey

THEN RUN THIS COMMAND:
php artisan migrate

NOW, THAT THE NECESSARY SETUP FOR LARAVEL WAS ESTABLISH, NOW SETTING UP FOR THE FRONTEND

FIRST, WE RUN: npm init vite vue

THEN YOU HAVE TO SELECT A FRAMEWORK THEN CHOOSE vue
THEN YOU'LL BE SELECTING A VARIANT, CHOOSE vue

AFTER SETTING UP VUE, GO TO VUE FOLDER BY RUNNING COMMAND:
cd vue

AFTER THAT RUN THIS COMMAND (NOTE YOU MUST BE INSIDE FOLDER OF VUE, MENTIONED ABOVE):
npm i && npm run dev

STILL AT VUE FOLDER,  RUN THIS COMMAND:
npm install -S vuex@next

NOW, CREATE A FOLDER IN vue/src/ NAMED "store"
IN THIS NEW FOLDER CREATE A FILE index.js

STILL IN VUE FOLDER, RUN THESE COMMAND TO INSTALL TAILWIND CSS:
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

THEN WE MODIFY THE content IN tailwind.config.js 
NOTE ABOUT MODIFYING tailwind.config.js, YOU MUST FOLLOW THE DOCUMENTATION FOR VITE:
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite

WE CREATE index.css IN src FOLER (THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN SEE App.vue)
AND PASTE THESE TAILWIND UTILITIES:
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

THEN IMPORT THIS FILE TO main.js (YOU CAN SEE main.js IN src FOLDER ALONG WITH App.vue)

STILL ON vue FOLDER, RUN THIS COMMAND:
npm install @headlessui/vue @heroicons/vue @tailwindcss/forms -S

WE COPY A CODE IN THIS LINK:
