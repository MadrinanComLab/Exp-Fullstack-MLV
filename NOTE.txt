OTHER SOURCES WE USED FOR THIS PROJECT:
FOR TAILWIND UI:
https://tailwindui.com/

FOR ICONS. SINCE WE CAN'T USE FA CLASSES BECAUSE THAT IS ONLY WORKS ON BOOTSTRAP, WE USE THIS INSTEAD:
https://heroicons.com/

IN EARLIER PHASE, RUNNING OF LARAVEL AND VUE HAS DIFFERENT COMMAND:
LARAVEL: php artisan serve
VUE JS: npm run dev (GO TO VUE FOLDER FIRST, BEFORE RUNNING THIS COMMAND)

TO CREATE THIS LARAVEL PROJECT, WE RUN:
composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-vue-survey

THEN WE CREATE DATABASE: laravel_survey

AFTER CREATING DATABASE, WE MODIFY .env AND CHANGES THIS:
DB_DATABASE=laravel_survey

THEN RUN THIS COMMAND:
php artisan migrate

NOW, THAT THE NECESSARY SETUP FOR LARAVEL WAS ESTABLISH, NOW SETTING UP FOR THE FRONTEND

FIRST, WE RUN: npm init vite vue

THEN YOU HAVE TO SELECT A FRAMEWORK THEN CHOOSE vue
THEN YOU'LL BE SELECTING A VARIANT, CHOOSE vue

AFTER SETTING UP VUE, GO TO VUE FOLDER BY RUNNING COMMAND:
cd vue

AFTER THAT RUN THIS COMMAND (NOTE YOU MUST BE INSIDE FOLDER OF VUE, MENTIONED ABOVE):
npm i && npm run dev

STILL AT VUE FOLDER,  RUN THIS COMMAND:
npm install -S vuex@next

NOW, CREATE A FOLDER IN vue/src/ NAMED "store"
IN THIS NEW FOLDER CREATE A FILE index.js

STILL IN VUE FOLDER, RUN THESE COMMAND TO INSTALL TAILWIND CSS:
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

THEN WE MODIFY THE content IN tailwind.config.js 
NOTE ABOUT MODIFYING tailwind.config.js, YOU MUST FOLLOW THE DOCUMENTATION FOR VITE:
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite

WE CREATE index.css IN src FOLER (THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN SEE App.vue)
AND PASTE THESE TAILWIND UTILITIES:
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

THEN IMPORT THIS FILE TO main.js (YOU CAN SEE main.js IN src FOLDER ALONG WITH App.vue)

STILL ON vue FOLDER, RUN THIS COMMAND:
npm install @headlessui/vue @heroicons/vue @tailwindcss/forms -S

WE COPY A CODE IN THIS LINK:
https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/forms/sign-in-forms

PASTE THE CODE INSIDE <template> IN HelloWorld.vue COMPONENT AND MODIFY tailwind.config.js AND ADD THIS IN PLUGINS
require("@tailwindcss/forms")

STILL ON VUE FOLDER RUN THIS:
npm i -S vue-router@next

WE CREATED views FOLDER IN src FOLDER AND CREATE THE FF. COMPONENT:
Dashboard.vue
Login.vue
Registration.vue

ANOTHER COMPONENT WAS CREATED IN src/views:
Dashboard.vue
Survey.vue

BOTH OF THESE COMPONENT WILL SHARE PageComponent.vue IN src/components

AFTER THESE FOLLOWING IN FRONTEND, NOW WE'LL BACK IN BACKEND, WE'RE GOING TO CREATE PHP MIGRATION AND RUN THESE COMMAND (MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN ROOT DIRECTORY AND NOT IN vue):
php artisan make:model Survey -m
php artisan make:model SurveyQuestion -m
php artisan make:model SurveyAnswer -m
php artisan make:model SurveyQuestionAnswer -m

AFTER CREATING THIS MIGRATIONS, WE'LL MODIFY THEM (database/migrations)

AFTER DOING THE CHANGES IN MIGRATIONS, RUN THIS COMMAND:
php artisan migrate

AFTER THE MODIFICATION IN MIGRATION, GO TO app/Controllers, CREATE AuthController.php

AFTER THAT GO TO routes/api.php. MODIFY THIS AND CREATE A NEW ROUTE (WE CRETE '/register' IN THIS ROUTE FILE)

AFTER THIS CHANGES IN BACKEND, LET'S GO BACK ON FRONTEND. GO TO vue/src/views/Registration.vue
AFTER CHANGING Registration.vue, DO SOME CHANGES IN index.js

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ERROR WE'VE ENCOUNTER IN FIST INTEGRATION OF VUE AND LARAVEL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEW THINGS WE'VE ENCOUNTER AFTER THE FIRST INTEGRATION OF VUE AND LARAVEL:
1.) BEFORE TESTING THE REGISTER, MAKE SURE THAT THE LARAVEL IS RUNNING. COMMAND: php artisan serve
2.) CONTROLLERS IN App/Http/Controllers, MAKE SURE THAT YOUR NEW CONTROLLERS HAS NAME BASE ON WHAT IT WAS FILE NAME AND NOT THE DEFAULT 'Controller'
3.) IN PASSWORD, IT MUST CONTAIN LOWER AND UPPERCASE, SYMBOL AND NUMBER

EXAMPLE ACCOUNT PASSWORD IN THIS DEMO APP: 
+----------------------------------+-------------------+
| EMAIL                            | PASSWORD          |
+----------------------------------+-------------------+
| johncliffordmadrinan@example.com | Website@dmin29    |
| janedoe@example.com              | janeDoe<3         |
| herbertsantos123@example.com     | pASSwORD#123      |
+----------------------------------+-------------------+

CHANGES IN AuthController.php AND api.php HAS MADE
AS WELL AS Login.vue

INSTALL axios IN VUE FOLDER, RUN THIS COMMAND:
npm i -S axios

THEN WE CREATE axios.js IN vue/src

NOTE: AXIOS IS THE LIBRARY WE USE TO MAKE REQUEST FROM THE FRONT END

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> SOME NOTES HOW WE CREATE REQUEST FROM FRONT END TO BACK END
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FLOW OF CREATING REQUEST (THIS IS WHAT OBSERVED IN CREATING REQUEST FOR AUTHENTICATION PROCESS)
1. ON THE BACKEND
---> NEW FUNCTION WAS CREATED IN AuthController.php
---> CONNECT THIS NEW FUNCTION TO api.php (WHICH HANDLES THE POST REQUEST)
2. ON THE FRONT END
---> CREATING A SCRIPT FOR REMOVING OR SETTING A DATA SAVED IN THE FRONT END. THIS HAPPENS IN VUE COMPONENT THAT THE REQUEST HAPPENS.
     EXAMPLE: logout() WAS DEFINE IN DefaultLayout.vue BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE LOGOUT BUTTON
---> THE FUNCTION ABOVE, THE DATA TO BE MANIPULATED WAS IN vue/src/store/index.js AND TO ACCOMPLISH THIS MANIPULATION FUNCTION HAS TO BE CREATED IN action AND mutations ATTR. INSIDE createStore
